%%% \needspace{5\baselineskip}\begin{macro}{\@NoIndentAfter}
%
%  \noindent This command implements the main principle
%  behind this package. It checks whether it is followed by
%  a paragraph. If so, the command |\par| is temporarily
%  changed using |\everypar|, so that the following paragraph
%  is not indented. Immediately afterwards, default paragraph
%  behavior is restored with |\@restorepar| (from the \LaTeX{}
%  base).

%%% \needspace{5\baselineskip}\begin{macro}{\@NoIndentAfterEnv}
%
%  \noindent This command is used for hooking into the ending
%  routine of an environment at the latest possible point after
%  |\ignorespaces|. It is heavily inspired by David Carlisle
%  (\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/179034/38481}) and 
%  uses a delimited argument in order to apply |\@NoIndentAfter|
%  last. It is invoked through the hook |\AfterEndEnvironment| 
%  provided by package package |etoolbox| and leaves everything 
%  between its invocation and |\ignorespaces\fi| at the very end
%  of command |\end| unchanged---even additonal material given
%  through the same hook---and finally executes |\@NoIndentAfter|
%
